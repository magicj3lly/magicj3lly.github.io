I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My advisors are [Professor Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/) and [Professor Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi). My research span different facets of mobile software and systems security, and mobile measurement studies. I work on the analysis and detection of mobile malware in the wild, the security of mobile payment systems, and the phenomenon and impact of geofencing in the mobile domain. 

Previously, I worked in the Silicon Valley for over a decade in various engineering roles, leading to senior engineering roles. I have also had a short stint as a research faculty at Amrita University, India.
